Meet <span>THE BOSS</span>

<p>
Lucy Van Pelt, <span>THE BOSS</span>, has an outstanding track record in getting things done her way. She brings this bold style to her Match Making Services. It isn't by chance that she has earned the coveted 3M - Master Match Maker - title. With an eye for potentially great set ups, her dogged determination, and that special 'Lucy Knack', she has taken the scene literally by storm.</p>
